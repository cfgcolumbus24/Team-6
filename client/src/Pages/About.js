                <p>
                    Founded as Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, LMCC serves, connects, and makes space for artists and community.
                    Since 1973, LMCC has been the champion for independent artists in New York City and the cultural life force of
                    Lower Manhattan. We envision New York City as a place where artists and community in dialogue are creating
                    a more just, equitable, and sustainable society.

                            Art holds the power to transform, inspire, and connect us all. It challenges perspectives, brings diverse
                            communities together, and illuminates the beauty of shared human experiences. As champions of artistic
                            expression, we believe in the boundless potential of art to foster understanding, empathy, and positive change
                            within society. Through supporting artists and cultural initiatives, we strive to create a world enriched by
                            creativity, inclusivity, and a shared appreciation for the arts.
