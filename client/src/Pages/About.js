                <p>
                    Founded as Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, LMCC serves, connects, and makes space for artists, alumni, and the broader community. Since 1973, LMCC has championed independent artists in New York City and empowered alumni as lifelong members of a thriving cultural network in Lower Manhattan. We envision New York City as a place where artists and alumni, in dialogue with their communities, create a more just, equitable, and sustainable society.

                            Art holds the power to transform, inspire, and connect us all. It challenges perspectives, brings diverse communities together, and illuminates the beauty of shared human experiences. We believe that alumni engagement is equally transformative; it amplifies our impact, fosters mentorship, and builds a supportive network for artists across generations. Together, our alumni and LMCC can continue to foster understanding, empathy, and positive change within society, creating a world enriched by creativity, inclusivity, and a shared appreciation for the arts.
