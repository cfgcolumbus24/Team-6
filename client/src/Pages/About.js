                <p>
                    Founded as Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, LMCC serves, connects, and makes space for artists and community.
                    Since 1973, LMCC has been the champion for independent artists in New York City and the cultural life force of
                    Lower Manhattan. We envision New York City as a place in which artists and community in dialogue are creating
                    a more just, equitable, and sustainable society.
